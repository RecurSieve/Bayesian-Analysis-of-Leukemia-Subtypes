In the realm of medical research, particularly in the study of leukemia, understanding the
molecular and genetic differences between various subtypes is crucial for developing targeted
therapies and improving patient outcomes. Leukemia, a type of blood cancer, can be classified
into different subtypes based on the French-American-British (FAB) classification system. This
project aims to leverage Bayesian modeling techniques to analyze a leukemia dataset with the
primary objective of comparing posterior expectations between different FAB groups.
